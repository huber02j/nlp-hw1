How to build/run:

    work.py has the code to test each model. 
    Usage: ./work.py [OPTION]
      -unigram      trains unigram model and tests accuracy on data/dev
      -fivegram     trains 5-gram model and tests data/dev and data/test
      -both         trains and tests both models

    Part 1:
        run the program by typing ./work.py -unigram
        This will run the program to test the unigram model and output the accuracy when tested on data/dev
        The accuracy when run equals 16.48%

    Part 2:
        run the program by typing ./work.py -fivegram

        The accuracy on data/dev  = 49.49%
        The accuracy on data/test = 49.75%

    Part 3:
